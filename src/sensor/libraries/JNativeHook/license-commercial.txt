Alternate Licensing Options

In addition to the GNU General Public License, I offer business-friendly 
licensing options for JNativeHook.  If you wish to incorporate JNativeHook 
into your commercial software package where the terms of the GPL are not a 
viable option, you may choose to obtain a commercial license.  For more 
information on available licensing options, please contact me via email at 
alex@1stleg.com or by paper mail at the following address:
