# Occusense: Occupancy Sensing With Machine Learning And 3D imaging. 

## Third Year Group Projects in collaboration with Laing'O'Rourke.
This group project is born from the colaboriation between the construction company Laing'o'Rourke and a group of 8 students from Imperial College London. The main objectives of this project was to design a system able to detect, monitor and identify human behaviours. 
##### Inputs.
The Microsoft Kinect sensors were used for this project. The sensors collected human data, more precisely limbs length, that were then inputted to a machine algorithms.   
##### Computations.
The machine learning algorithms used performs classification. In this project, a random forest algorithm was used. 
##### Outputs.
The program outputs the following decisions thanks to the machine learning:
- Who is the person detected by the Microsoft Kinect? 
- What action is this person performing? The system is able to recognise walking, running, falling and sleeping actions.

##### Requirements.

The system requires:
  - Microsoft Kinect v1.8.
  - The Processing Environment.
  - The SimpleOpenNI library.
